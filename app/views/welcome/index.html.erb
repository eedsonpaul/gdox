<h1> What is Goweedox? </h1>

<p>The purpose of the application is to help those people who are working on the application for doctors, the CDM (developed and maintained by CareSharing) to share information with one another through an informative yet-not-boring documentation of the actual software. Basically, the idea is to make it a wikipedia- like documentation app, but in a way that is more pleasing to the eyes, thereby generating more interest to the user, making the documentation and the sharing of information a lot more effective.</p>

<p>The app has two modes (as of now): Edit and View. 
(1) View Mode: The user is taken to something like what is shown above, a screenshot of the software with annotations (those cute buttons) all around it. Clicking an annotation will show a page which is something like on the right panel. The right panel then shows the 'lessons' or articles that contain discussions about the usage or function of this button or that button, or this part or that part, and some other information. Of course, we won't crowd the user with a lot of unorganized texts, so a link of related topics would be first displayed.</p>

<p>(2) Edit Mode: This lets the user create annotations (to a specific application he wants to document), and then put lessons. Now how are these lessons going to be created? The answer is by using a desktop application called ScreenSteps. Actually, this web application goes hand in hand with this desktop app. Therefore, lessons are created on the desktop using ScreenSteps, and these are going to be somehow uploaded (they say there might be another way) to the web app. The problem is on how do we actually link or connect these two applications together. Well that's something that we have to figure out. </p>
